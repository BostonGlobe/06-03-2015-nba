# NBA "Last Two Minutes" officiating report

An analysis of the reports reviewing decisions at the end of close games. The NBA defines these as *"all games within five points at the two minute mark of regulation (and during overtime, where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls."*

## Questions
- How often are calls incorrect or missed in a close game?
- Do officials make more decisions in favor of the home team?
- What calls are officials getting wrong most often?
- What was the worst officiated game?
- How often does an incorrect call **directly** lead to points?
- Do the incorrect calls tend to make the game closer or further?
